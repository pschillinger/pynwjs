Installation
============

PyNWJS requires an installation both on the Python side
and on the JavaScript side.

* **Python**

    Install for current user as:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd path/to/pynwjs
        pip install --user -e .

* **JavaScript**

    Install for current user as:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cd ~
        npm install path/to/pynwjs

In addition, you will need the *nwjs* binaries
to run any app developed with PyNWJS.

For the tutorials and local development, it is recommended to
download the SDK version from the official website:
